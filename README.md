This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript's error handling.  The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problematic code, where `Err.Raise` is used without sufficient context or recovery mechanisms. This can lead to abrupt script termination and difficulties in debugging.  The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, showing best practices for handling exceptions gracefully in VBScript.
